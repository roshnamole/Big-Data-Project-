Big Data Project Proposal for ASOS Marketplace
Proposal for ASOS Marketplace
I took the initiative to pitch ASOS Marketplace as the focus of our group project, recognizing its prominence in e-commerce and the critical issue of high return rates affecting both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. I effectively communicated the strategic value of addressing this challenge using big data analytics, which resonated with the team. My enthusiasm and clear articulation of the potential impact led to unanimous agreement, setting the stage for our successful project execution. This experience reinforced my ability to identify and advocate for valuable opportunities in data-driven business projects.
